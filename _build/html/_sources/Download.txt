The project is stored and mantained at an online repository that can be accesed `here <https://github.com/jlrandulfe/UviSpace>`_. 
The project can be directly downloaded from the repository page. However, it is recommended to `install git <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`_ and then clone the project to a local repository. This way, you can use the *git version control system* in order to collaborate to the project and easily synchronize your work with the other developers.

Once you have git installed and configured, type the following instructions for cloning the UviSpace project to your PC::

    cd /go/to/desired/directory     #Set the terminal working directory
    git clone https://github.com/jlrandulfe/UviSpace.git    #Clone the project to your local machine
    
After that, the project will be cloned to a folder named UviSpace into the directory you have specified.
