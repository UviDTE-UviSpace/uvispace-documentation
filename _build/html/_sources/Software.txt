Software project
================

The software subproject inside the UviSpace project is called uvispace as well. It is a **Python2.7** project, and it is structured into 2 main packages, namely *uvirobot* and *uvisensor*. 

uvirobot
^^^^^^^^

The *uvirobot* package consist in 2 callable scripts:

- **messenger.py** stablishes the communication to the specified UGV, using the ZigBee protocol. Thus, prior runnning it an XBee module has to be connected to the PC, and another one to the Arduino board serial port, and both configured accordingly. Once the communication is stablished, the module *listens* to speed set points and send them to the UGV. When the execution is cancelled, a plot with the delay times is obtained and then the program ends.
- **move_robot.py** *listens* to input UGV position values and destination coordinates, calculates the UGV optimal path, and finally outputs the speed set points needed to achieve the planned path.
    
Moreover, there are 5 importable libraries inside the *uvirobot* package:

- **path_tracker.py** contains a class whose methods calculate an UGV's path points, once given a position and destination, and then stores them in an attribute.
- **plotter.py** contains functions used to construct a graph with a predefined format. It is designed to map the calculated vs. real path of an UGV, and the delay times.
- **robot.py** contains the *RobotController()* class, where each instantiated object represents an UGV, and stablishes the upper interface for working with its speed values.
- **serialcomm.py** contains the *SerMesProtocol()* class, which is a child of the built-in python *pyserial* class. It defines a serial protocol, which will be used by the XBee modules for communicating the CPU with an UGV.
- **speedtransform.py** contains the *Speed()* class, for dealing with operations related to the speed values, such as transform between different scales or ensuring that the values are between valid boundaries.
    
Finally, the package contains an auxiliary module into the *resources* folder, called *teleoperation.py*. This is a callable module that allows to control the UGV with the keyboard, which is specially useful when the *uvispace* package has to be tested.

uvisensor
^^^^^^^^^

The *uvisensor* contains 1 callable module, **multiplecamera.py**. It is based on multithreading. The purpose of this module is to manage the information of N cameras, merge the vertices of every tracker and obtain the final number of UGVs(triangles) with their pose. There is a shared variable with all the vertices obtained from each camera.

The connection via TCP/IP to the cameras, as well as the processing of the images from each camera, is achieved in parallel.

Finally, another thread communicates with the user in order to get commands. At the moment, the only command is 'Quit Program' ('Q'), but this functionality can be easily increased in the future.

Summing up, the list of threads is:

* 1 main thread that will merge the information from every camera (VideoSensor).
* N threads for getting data from the N cameras connected to the system.
* 1 user oriented thread for getting commands from the user.

The package has, as well, 4 importable modules:

* **client.py** contains the *Client()* class, which is a child of the *Socket* class from the *socket.socket* built-in Python module. This class contains methods for communicating specifically with the design FPGA hardware. Its methods allow to open and close the connection correctly, and to write and read from valid registers with the right format.
* **geometry.py** contains 2 classes. The *Triangle()* class is used for performing geometrical operations inherent to isosceles triangles, in order to get its base length, barycenter, position, angle... The *Segment()* class is used to determine a segment from its 2 points, and calculate afterwards the distance to another point.
* **imgprocessing.py** contains the *Image()* class, which has image-oriented methods, based on matrix operations, for getting useful information from image data.
* **videosensor.py** has the *VideoSensor()* class and several functions related to it. Each instantiated object represent an external FPGA device. Thus, this class has methods for setting up the TCP/IP connection, configuring the FPGA registers, and interact with it.
