Angstrom
========

This guide follows the process required to build a fully functional image of the
Angstrom distribution to be run in a SoCFPGA platform, like the DE0-Nano-Soc.

Requisites
----------

The requirements for this guide are the following:

- Linux PC with Internet access and support for the
  following commands:
  mount, umount, fdisk, losetup, partprobe, and dd
- Blank microSD card.

Preloader
---------

The first piece we have to generate in order to be able to boot our system is the Preloader,
also known as Secondary System Loader (SPL). The Preloader is a piece of software that
will be called from the Boot ROM, whose purpose is to set up the system to a point where
the Bootloader can be run. This process involves setting up the hardware components of the system,
so it has to be regenerated every time the hardware design is changed.

To generate the Preloader, there is a tool called *BSP Editor* that can handle its creation. This
tool takes in all the hardware/software handoff files (generated by Qsys/Quartus), allows to set
configuration options, and outputs a set of source code files that can be compiled into a Preloader
image.

The first step is to start the embedded command shell:

  <path-to-soceds-tools>/embedded/embedded_command_shell.sh


UBoot
-----

To generate UBoot.

Kernel and Root Filesystem
--------------------------

To generate the kernel and root filesystem.
